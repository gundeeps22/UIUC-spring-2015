\item\mbox{}\textbf{Channel Rates and Shared Media}\\
    You are entrusted with the design of a network to interconnect a set of geographically distributed hosts within your corporation. After some research, you narrow the options to two choices, a fiber-based or a copper-based network. The pertinent statistics appear in the table below.
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            Type & fiber-based network & copper-based network\\
            \hline
            signal bandwidth & 10 MHz & 1 MHz\\
            \hline
            signal-to-noise ratio at transmitter & 20 dB & 20 dB\\
            \hline
            attenuation rate & 1 dB/km & 2 dB/km\\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    The longest link in the network in either case is 10 km.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item What link bandwidth is possible according to Shannon's Law
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item for the fiber network?\\
            \color{blue}
            $\because$ the attenuation rate for fiber-based netork is 1 dB/km\\
            $\therefore$ the worst signal-to-noise ratio at receiver is $20 - 1 \times 10 = 10 (\mbox{dB})$\\
            $\Rightarrow 10 = 10\ log_2(SNR)$\\
            $\Rightarrow SNR = 10$\\
            $\mbox{link bandwidth} = \mbox{B}\log_2(1 + SNR) = 10 \times 10^6 \times \log_2 (1 + 10)$\\
            $\simeq 34.59 \times 10^6 (bps)$\\
            $= 34.59 (Mbps)$
            \color{black}
        \item for the copper network?\\
            \color{blue}
            $\because$ the attenuation rate for copper-based netork is 1 dB/km\\
            $\therefore$ the worst signal-to-noise ratio at receiver is $20 - 2 \times 10 = 0 (\mbox{dB})$\\
            $\Rightarrow 0 = 10\ log_2(SNR)$\\
            $\Rightarrow SNR = 1$\\
            $\mbox{link bandwidth} = \mbox{B}\log_2(1 + SNR) = 1 \times 10^6 \times \log_2 (1 + 1)$\\
            $= 1 \times 10^6 (bps)$\\
            $= 1 (Mbps)$
            \color{black}
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Assuming that hosts in the copper network can all transmit at their link rate (the values found in part (a)) simultaneously, roughly how many hosts are necessary for the networks to provide equal aggregate bandwidth (the sum of bandwidth for all hosts)?\\
        \color{blue}
        From (a),\\
        $34.59 / 1 = 34.59 \simeq 35$\\
        $\Rightarrow$ 35 hosts are necessary for the networks to provide equal aggregate bandwidth.
        \color{black}
    \item Using the copper-based network with a 32-point QAM encoding, what modulation rate (baud) is necessary to obtain the bandwidth found in part (a)?\\
        \color{blue}
        32-point QAM encoding denotes $\log_232 = 5$ bits per symbol\\
        Suppose $x$ baud is necessary to obtain the bandwidth found in part (a)\\
        $x \times 5 = 1 \times 10^6$\\
        $\Rightarrow x = 2 \times 10^5 (baud)$
        \color{black}

\item\mbox{} \textbf{Medium Access Control}\\
    This question concerns medium access control on a network using carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD, the algorithm used with Ethernet). The network consists of four hosts distributed as shown in the figure below. The medium are broadcast, and the signal travels directly along a line of sight from sender to all receivers. Assume that the signals propagate at the speed of light in a vacuum, $3 \times 10^8 m/sec$
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \tikzstyle{main node}=[draw,auto,node distance=100pt,circle,align=center,fill=green]
            \node[main node] (A) {A};
            \node[main node] (B) [right of=A] {B};
            \node[main node] (C) [below right of=A] {C};
            \node[main node] (D) [below right of=B] {D};

            \draw (A) -- (B) node[draw=none,fill=none,midway,above] {54 km};
            \draw (A) -- (C) node[draw=none,fill=none,midway,above] {40 km};
            \draw (A) -- (D) node[draw=none,fill=none,near end,above] {90 km};
            \draw (B) -- (C) node[draw=none,fill=none,near start,above] {51 km};
            \draw (B) -- (D) node[draw=none,fill=none,midway,above] {57 km};
            \draw (C) -- (D) node[draw=none,fill=none,midway,above] {57 km};
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If a transmitter sends at 1 Mbps, how long must packets be to guarantee collision detection by the transmitter?\\
        \color{blue}
        The longest path in the network $= 90 (km) = 90 \times 10^3 (m)$\\
        Round trip time of the longest path $= 2 \times \frac{90 \times 10^3}{3 \times 10^8} = 600 \times 10^{-6} (s) = 600 (\mu s)$\\
        Minimum packet size to guarantee collision detection by the transmitter $= 600 \times 10^{-6} \times 1 \times 10^6 = 600 (bit) = 75 (B)$
        \color{black}
    \item Divide time into slots the length of the maximum round-trip propagation delay in the network. One packet may be transmitted each time slot. Assume that each of the four hosts attempts to transmit with probability $p$ in each time slot. What is the probability of a successful transmission in any given slot if
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item $p = \frac{1}{4}$\\
            \color{blue}
            $C_1^{4} \times p \times (1 - p)^3 = C_1^{4} \times \frac{1}{4} \times (1 - \frac{1}{4})^3 = \frac{27}{64}$
            \color{black}
        \item $p = \frac{1}{2}$\\
            \color{blue}
            $C_1^{4} \times p \times (1 - p)^3 = C_1^{4} \times \frac{1}{2} \times (1 - \frac{1}{2})^3 = \frac{1}{4}$
            \color{black}
        \item $p = \frac{3}{4}$\\
            \color{blue}
            $C_1^{4} \times p \times (1 - p)^3 = C_1^{4} \times \frac{3}{4} \times (1 - \frac{3}{4})^3 = \frac{3}{64}$
            \color{black}
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Using the minimum transmission length from part (a) and the probability of successful transmission from part (b)(ii) (for $p = \frac{1}{2}$), calculate the average throughput of the network if each packet requires 20 bytes of header/trailer and
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item 10 bytes of data, and\\
            \color{blue}
            From (a), the packet size is $75 (B)$. From (b)(ii), the probability of successful transmission is $\frac{1}{4}$\\
            The minimum packet size is 75B. Therefore, if the sum of the header/trailer and data is less than 75B, padding bytes must be added.\\
            $\Rightarrow$ the average throughput of the network is $\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{10}{75} \times 1 \times 10^6 \simeq 33.3 \times 10^3 (bps)$\\
            $= 33.3 (Kbps)$
            \color{black}
        \item 50 bytes of data.\\
            \color{blue}
            From (a), the packet size is $75 (B)$. From (b)(ii), the probability of successful transmission is $\frac{1}{4}$\\
            The minimum packet size is 75B. Therefore, if the sum of the header/trailer and data is less than 75B, padding bytes must be added.\\
            $\Rightarrow$ the average throughput of the network is $\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{50}{75} \times 1 \times 10^6 \simeq 166.7 \times 10^3 (bps)$\\
            $= 166.7 (Kbps)$
            \color{black}
        \end{enumerate}

\item\mbox{}\textbf{Workstations as Switches}\\
    You are entrusted with the purchase of a workstation to serve as a switch between two high-speed local area networks (LAN's). One of the networks is an UltraNet, a 1 Gbps LAN with 80 bytes of total overhead (headers and trailers) required for each frame. The other network is an OmniNet, a 1.3 Gbps LAN with 100 bytes of overhead required for each frame. All packets sent on either network have exactly 1,000 bytes of data. After some research, you narrow the options to the two architectures described in the table below.
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            Name & Admiral J9000 & SPQ\\
            \hline
            CPU handles & 100,000 packets/second & 60,000 packets/second\\
            \hline
            Number of I/O buses & 3 & 1\\
            \hline
            I/O bus bandwidth & 480 Mbps & 1 Gbps\\
            \hline
            Memory bus bandwidth & 2 Gbps & 1.4 Gbps\\
            \hline
            Price & \$10,000 & \$8,000\\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Pick one. Justify your decision, showing all work.\\
        \color{blue}
        Determine either CPU, I/O bus bandwidth, or memory bus bandwidth will be the bottleneck of the workstation:
        \begin{tabular}{lll}
            \toprule
            Name & Admiral J9000 & SPQ\\
            \hline
            CPU & $100000 \times 1000 \times 8 = 800 \times 10^6 (bps)$ & $60000 \times 1000 \times 8 = 480 \times 10^6 (bps)$\\
                & $= 800 (Mbps)$ & $= 480 (Mbps)$\\
            I/O bus bandwidth & $\frac{2 \times 480}{2} = 480 (Mbps)$ & $\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 (Gbps) = 500 (Mbps)$\\
            memory bus bandwidth & $\frac{2}{2} = 1 (Gbps)$ & $\frac{1.4}{2} = 0.7 (Gbps) = 700 (Mbps)$\\
            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}\\

        $\because$ both Admiral J9000 and SPQ have the same bottleneck, which is $480 (Mbps)$\\
        $\therefore$ I will choose SPQ because it is cheaper
        \color{black}
    \item Draw a block diagram of the workstation architecture that you have chosen in part (a), labeling all components with appropriate names and data rates.\\
        \includegraphics[width=4in]{images/p3b_block_diagram}
    \item At the maximum sustainable bandwidth (i.e., with no packets dropped), what is the transmission rate - the total number of bits per second, including headers and trailers - sent over each network link?\\
        \color{blue}
        For UltraNet, transmission rate $= 480 \times \frac{1000 + 80}{1000} = 518.4 (Mbps)$\\
        For OmniNet, transmission rate $= 480 \times \frac{1000 + 100}{1000} = 528 (Mbps)$

\item\mbox{}\textbf{Forwarding Tables}\\
    Consider the network shown in the figure below. The links are labeled with relative costs. The three parts of this problem deal with datagram forwarding, circuit-switched forwarding, and source-routed forwarding, respectively
    \begin{center}

    \end{center}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Give the datagram routing table at switch S2, assuming least-cost paths are used. Your table should consist of one row for each possible destination (including the default destination, OUT) consisting of the destination ID, output port, and distance\\
        \color{blue}
        \begin{tabular}{ccc}
            \toprule
            destination ID & output port & distance\\

            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
        \color{black}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Using the bit-stuffing protocol discussed in class, what is the average number of bits that must be stuffed (inserted) per byte in the stream?\\
        \color{blue}
        $\because$ the value only ranges from 0 to 127\\
        $\therefore$ the first bit in any byte must be 0\\
        $\Rightarrow$ the possible sequences need to be stuffed:\\
        \begin{tabular}{cccccccc}
            0 & \underline{\ } & \underline{\ } & 1 & 1 & 1 & \underline{\ } & \underline{\ }\\
              & 0 & 0 & & & & 1 & 1\\

              & 0 & 1 & & & & 1 & 1\\

              & 1 & 1 & & & & 1 & 1\\
        \end{tabular}\\
        there are 8 possible sequences need to be stuffed\\
        $\Rightarrow$ the average number of bits that must be stuffed per byte in the stream $= \frac{8}{128} \times 1$\\
        $= \frac{1}{16}$
        \color{black}
    \item Answer the same question posed in part (a) for a byte-stuffing protocol in which the DLE character (value 16) must be escaped by stuffing a second DLE byte.\\
        \color{blue}
        the DLE character (value 16) denotes the sequence of 00010000\\
        $\Rightarrow$ the average number of bits that must be stuffed per byte in the stream $= \frac{1}{128} \times 8$\\
        $= \frac{1}{16}$
        \color{black}
    \end{enumerate}
    Now assume that the data stream contains only value in the range 32 to 127, again with a uniform probability distribution amongst the possible values.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Recalcuate your answer to part (a) with the new probability distribution.\\
        \color{blue}
        $\because$ the value only ranges from 32 to 127\\
        $\therefore$ the bit sequence must start with 01 or 001\\
        $\Rightarrow$ the possible sequences need to be stuffed:\\
        \begin{tabular}[t]{cccccccc}
            0 & 1 & \underline{\ } & 1 & 1 & 1 & \underline{\ } & \underline{\ }\\

        there are 7 possible sequences need to be stuffed, and the total number of possible sequences is $127 - 32 + 1 = 96$\\
        $\Rightarrow$ the average number of bits that must be stuffed per byte in the stream $= \frac{7}{96}$
        \color{black}
    \item Recalcuate your answer to part (b) with the new probability distribution.\\
        \color{blue}
        $\because$ the bit sequence must start with 01 or 001, and the DEL character (value 16) denotes the sequence of 00010000\\
        $\therefore$ there is no need to stuff for any bit sequence from 32 to 127\\
        $\Rightarrow$ the average number of bits that must be stuffed per byte in the stream $= 0$

\item\mbox{}\textbf{Switch Fabrics}\\
    Banyan and Batcher networks are two types of self-routing fabrics often used to construct large switches from simpler components. A single stage of a $n \times n$ Banyan network consists of $n / 2$ switches of dimension $2 \times 2$. An $n \times n$ Batcher network can be made from two Batcher networks of size $n / 2 \times n / 2$ plus a merge network with $n / 2\  \log_2 n$ switches.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item For $n = 32$, how many stages are required to route packets from the inputs to the outputs of a Banyan Network?\\
        \color{blue}
        $n$ inputs require $\log_2 n$ stages\\
        $\Rightarrow \log_2 n = \log_2 32 = 5$
        \color{black}
    \item How many $2 \times 2$ switches are required for the network in part (a)?\\
        \color{blue}
        $\because$ each stage consists of $n / 2$ switches of dimension $2 \times 2$\\
        $\therefore$ the total amount of $2 \times 2$ switches required for the network in part (a) is $5 \times (n / 2) = 5 \times (32 / 2) = 80$
        \color{black}
    \item Write down a recurrence relation $T(n)$ for the number of switches in a Batcher network of size $n \times n$.\\
        \color{blue}
        According to the statement, an $n \times n$ Batcher network can be made from two Batcher networks of size $n / 2 \times n / 2$ plus a merge network with $n / 2\ \log_2 n$ switches, which can be interpreted as\\
        $T(n) = 2\ T(n / 2) + \frac{n}{2}\log_2 n$
        \color{black}
    \item Give the nubmer of switches required for $n = 16$.\\
        \color{blue}
        $T(2) = 1$\\
        $T(4) = 2\ T(4 / 2) + \frac{4}{2}\log_2 4 = 6$\\
        $T(8) = 2\ T(8 / 2) + \frac{8}{2}\log_2 8 = 24$\\
        $T(16) = 2\ T(16 / 2) + \frac{16}{2}\log_2 16 = 80$\\
        Batcher network requires 80 switches of dimension $2 \times 2$\\
        Banyan network requires $\log_2 16 \times \frac{16}{2} = 32$ switches of dimension $2 \times 2$\\
        $\Rightarrow$ the number of switches required for $n = 16$ is $80 + 32 = 112$

    Instead of updating routing table to ``A unreachable'', all nodes believe that A is still reachable, which is obviously contradict to the real situation. This is the well-known ``count to infinity'' problem. Nodes will keep sending updating messages and forwarding packets toward A, which is a waste of bandwidth.

\item\mbox{}Suppose packets on a wireless link consist of $N$ data bits and $H$ header bits each, where $H$ is fixed. Suppose bits are received in error with probability $P$, independently of each other, and that $N$ is adjusted to maximize the throughput of data in bits per second. If $P$ gets larger, does the optimal value of $N$ get larger or smaller? Why?\\
    \color{blue}
    The probability for a packet to be received in success $= (1 - P)^{N+H}$\\
    $\Rightarrow$ throughput in bits per second $= (1 - P)^{N+H} \times N \times \frac{B}{N + H}$\\
    where $B$ is the bandwidth\\
    $\because (1 - P)^{N+H}$ is more sensitive to change of $N$\\
    $\therefore$ as $P$ gets larger, $N$ should get smaller to give the maximum throughput

    \color{black}
% 52
\item\mbox{}Explain why a CSMA/CD type protocol cannot be used in a wireless environment.\\
    \color{blue}
    Most radios are half-duplex, which means that they cannot listen for collision while transmitting. Therefore, collisions may not be detected by the sender.
    \color{black}
% 53
\item\mbox{}For a small data packet, which is more relevant, bandwidth or latency? Explain.\\
    \color{blue}
    Latency, because propagation delay dominates if the packet is small and transmission delay dominates if the packet is large.
    \color{black}
% 54
\item\mbox{}Explain the benefits gained by framing.\\
    \color{blue}
    A benefit gained by framing is efficient error detection. By breaking up the entire message into recoverable chunks, each chunks can be checked for error and resent instead of checking the entire message.
    \color{black}
% 55
\item\mbox{}Under what circumstances will error detection using CRC fail?\\
    \color{blue}
    Errors which is a multiple of CRC will cause the CRC error detection fail.

% 57
\item\mbox{}In Ethernet, how does a sender detect a collision?\\
    \color{blue}
    If a sender detects some bits transmit from other hosts, then the sender detect a collision.
    \color{black}
% 58
\item\mbox{} Why does Ethernet use binary exponential backoff during contetion resolution?\\
    \color{blue}
    Ethernet doubles maximum backoff for the next round because doing so can let the next round have less possibility to occur a collision.
    \color{black}
% 59
\item\mbox{}Describe the role of the receiver in Ethernet. How is this different from the role of the receiver in IEEE 802.11?
    \color{blue}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Ethernet: receiver just pull the packet from the network
        \item IEEE 802.11: receiver is more active, not only pulling packets from the network, it also sends CTS and ACK to senders and other nodes
        \end{itemize}
    \color{black}
% 60
\item\mbox{}Why does Ethernet have a minimum packet size? How is it determined?\\
    \color{blue}
    Because Ethernet needs to detect collisions, and the minimum packet size must let senders still sending after $2T$, where $T$ is the propagation delay to the other host.
    \color{black}
% 61
\item\mbox{}What do ``learning'' bridges actually lean? What do the use this information for?\\
    \color{blue}
    ``Learning'' bridges learn which hosts live on which LAN. They use the information to maintain forwarding table and reduce redundant transmission.
    \color{black}
% 62
\item\mbox{}What are the limitations of bridges?\\
    \color{blue}
    Bridges are not scalable and are not heterogeneous.
    \color{black}
% 63
\item\mbox{}How do sniffers work? Will they work on all networks?\\
    \color{blue}
    Sniffers eavesdrop the packest on the shared media. Sniffers only work on networks broadcast.
    \color{black}
% 64
\item\mbox{}Why does Ethernet used fixed time slots during backoff? What could go wrong if the fixed slots were not used?\\
    \color{blue}
    Fixed time slot can make sure that all messages are sent before a host can send a message again. If the fixed time slot is not used, there might be messages in transiting and it will cause more collision when hosts try to send a message.

    \color{blue}
    Label swapping maps the VCI to a new value at each hop. Therefore, a packet just needs to follow VCI at each hop after setting up virtual circuits.

\item\mbox{}Why is determining and handling byte order left up to the programmer and not handled by the operating system?\\
    \color{blue}
    Because when data link does the ``Encoding'', data link layer does not know what byte order the system use. Programmer has to change the network byte order into system byte order.

\item\mbox{} Why can 4B/5B encoding be transmitted using NRZI?\\
    \color{blue}
    Because after encoding every four bits as a five bit symbol, each symbol has at least two 1s, which means that using NRZI guarantees at least two transitions for each code.

        \draw[thin] (C) -- (D);
    \end{tikzpicture}\\
    As the figure shows. When A transmits to B, C needs to be idle so that C will not interfere with B, and at this moment, D can transmit to E because D will not interfere with B.

\item\mbox{}What is the effect of setting ``infinity'' to 16 in distance vector routing?\\
    \color{blue}
    Advantage: Small limit allows fast completion of ``counting to infinity''\\
    Disadvantage: Limit the size of the network

\item\mbox{}\textbf{Bit- and Byte-Stuffing}\\
    Consider a data stream of 8-bit ASCII characters with values 0 to 255. Assume that the probability of a byte assuming each possible is equal (i.e., is exactly 1/256).
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Using the bit-stuffing protocol discussed in class, what is the average number of bits that must be stuffed (inserted) per byte in the stream?\\
    \item Answer the same question posed in part (a) for a byte-stuffing protocol in which the DLE character (value 16) must be escaped by stuffing a second DLE byte.\\
    \end{enumerate}
    Now assume that the data stream contains only value in the range 32 to 255, again with a uniform probability distribution amongst the possible values.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Recalcuate your answer to part (a) with the new probability distribution.\\
    \item Recalcuate your answer to part (b) with the new probability distribution.\\
    \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
